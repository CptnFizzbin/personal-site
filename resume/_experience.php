        For the first of three co-op placement for my course at Gerogian College, I worked as an Interactive Programmer. The first month of the placement was learning the <strong>Ruby</strong> language, and its web framework <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. Ruby quickly became my favorite language for dynamic web applications. In the next month, working with a colleague, we created an internal project management web application called Proja. This application was created from scrach with Rails, and the <strong>BootStrap</strong> front end framework. At this placement I also learned about <strong>Test Driven Development</strong> and its Red-Green-Refactor development cycle.

        For the second of three co-op placements for my course at Georgian College, I worked as a Customer Support/Developer for Avetti's primary product, <a href="http://www.avetticommerce.com/">Commerce8</a>. The languages I mainly worked in were <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong>, and <strong>Velocity</strong>. As part of my placement, I assisted in researching new technologies and practices for Ecommerce sites, along with new plugins to enhance the online stores, and simplify things for future developers. Two of the changes I recommended were the installation of <strong>Mustache</strong> Templates for JavaScript rendered sections, and replacing the TextBox Velocity editor with the powerful, code focused <a href="http://ace.c9.io/">Ace Editor</a>. This placement was also the most imformative experiece about the "real" world outside of school.
