          I am currently in my final semester at Georgian College for Computer
          Programmer/Analyst, focusing on web technologies. I enjoy working
          in the Internet industry because it allows people to use tools and
          applications without having to install them on their devices. It also
          allows for the same tool to be used on anywhere that has an Internet
          connection.

          I am very passionate about learning new tools, and discovering new
          ways to do things. I also strive to produce code that is easy to
          understand as I makes it easier for other developers to modify my
          code.
