          With a group of 8 other students at Georgian college, we are developing
          an internal application for local Barrie business Not Just Kibble. The
          tool is designed and developed to keep track of Not Just Kibble's clients
          to ensure safety of the dogs, and to help manage schedules.

          For a final project for my Web Programming class, I created a basic
          forum board using PHP from scratch. This forum system included profiles,
          and some BBCode support. In the next semester, with another student, we
          recreated the forum board using Object Oriented PHP.<span class="no-print">
          This forum board can be viewed on the <a href="projects/">projects page</a>.</span>

          In grade 12 at Orangeville District Secondary School, two other students
          and I spent four months working together to create an RPG Flash game.
          For the project I developed most of the back-end systems, including the
          map rendering system, and the inventory system. Although the game was
          never fully completed, it does work, and has a few playable levels, and
          many many bugs.<span class="no-print"> The game can be found on the
          <a href="projects/">project page</a>.</span>
