            <h3>PHP</h3>
            <p>
              Although I seem to be in the minority, PHP is my preferred web
              language, due to how common it is. I have worked with PHP throughout
              my College career, and used it extensively at One More Story Games
              during my co-op there.

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
              Over the last four months I have worked on an Angular app with other
              students at Georgian Collage as part of our schooling. I have enjoyed
              working with JavaScript because of it's simplicity, and power. In my
              work, I have used both JQuery and recently Angular.

            <h3>SQL</h3>
            <p>
              Although I often look for libraries to handle database interactions,
              I am quite familiar with SQL queries, and am able to write my own SQL when
              a library doesn't cover what I need. In the past I have worked with
              PostgreSQL servers, but my favorite flavour is MySQL because of its
              widespread usage.
