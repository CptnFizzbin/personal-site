          Working at One More Story Games was an incredible experience. I had
          worked with a team of 8 other co-ops to develop and create their
          Interactive Fiction tool StoryStylus. While there, I helped to migrate
          their development environment over to Virtual Machines powered by Vagrant.
          I also helped to implement an encryption system to secure their app's
          web traffic. During the final few months there, I helped to move their
          Adobe Flash AIR app onto android devices.

          For the second of three co-op placements for my course at Georgian
          College, I worked as a Customer Support/Developer for Avetti's
          primary product, <a href="http://www.avetticommerce.com/">Commerce8</a>.
          The languages I mainly worked in were <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
          <strong>JQuery</strong>, and <strong>Velocity</strong>. As part of
          my placement, I assisted in researching new technologies and practices
          for Ecommerce sites, along with new plug-ins to enhance the on-line stores,
          and simplify things for future developers. Two of the changes I recommended
          were the installation of <strong>Mustache</strong> Templates for JavaScript
          rendered sections, and replacing the TextBox Velocity editor with the
          powerful, code focused <a href="http://ace.c9.io/">Ace Editor</a>. This
          placement was also the most informative experience about the "real" world
          outside of school.

          For the first of three co-op placement for my course at Georgian College,
          I worked as an Interactive Programmer. The first month of the placement
          was learning the <strong>Ruby</strong> language, and its web framework
          <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. Ruby quickly became my favorite language
          for dynamic web applications. In the next month, working with a colleague,
          we created an internal project management web application called Proja.
          This application was created from scratch with Rails, and the
          <strong>BootStrap</strong> front end framework. At this placement I also
          learned about <strong>Test Driven Development</strong> and its
          Red-Green-Refactor development cycle.
