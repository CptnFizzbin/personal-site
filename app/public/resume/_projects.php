          For a final project for my Web Programming class, I created a basic forum board using PHP from scratch. This forum system included profiles, and some BBCode support. In the next semister, with another student, we recreated the forum board using Object Oriented PHP.<span class="no-print"> This fourm board can be viewed on the <a href="projects/">projects page</a>.</span>

          In grade 12 at Orangeville District Secondary School, two other students and I spent four months working together to create an RPG Flash game. For the project I developed most of the back-end systems, including the map rendering system, and the inventory system. Although the game was never fully completed, it does work, and has a few playable levels, and many many bugs.<span class="no-print"> The game can be found on the project page.</span>

          For a final project for my first year Computer Architecture class, I created a small Maze game that was displayed on a TV screen via a RCA connection. This maze game featured a timer, points and randomly generated levels. Each maze was created using the "Hunt and Kill" algorithm, which offered the best maze while using the least amount of resources.

          One of my first pratical desktop applications was a small program designed to assist students and teachers at Orangeville District Secondary School. The program copied, renamed and moved a file to a teacher’s networked “handin” folder.
